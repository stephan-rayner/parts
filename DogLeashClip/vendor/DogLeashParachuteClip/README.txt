# Summary

I needed a replacement clip for a dog collar but since the collar material was sewn shut, I couldn't simply remove the broken clip and slide on a new one.  Instead I had to break off what remained of the old clip and attach the new one without breaking the seams of the collar.  That's where this clip comes in.  It features a small gap where the collar portion goes which allows you to pull the collar material through it to attach the new clip without breaking the collar seams.

I have "stress tested" it by taking my dog for a walk and by pulling on it with all of my strength, and it seems extremely sturdy!  I wouldn't trust it with a body weight load or anything but it allowed me to keep a collar instead of throwing it away.

Notes: 
I used 100% infill as I am using it for my dog's collar and I didn't want pieces to snap.  When completed I fed the collar material between the gap and pull it through using a needle nose pliers as it was too small of a space to get my fingers into.
