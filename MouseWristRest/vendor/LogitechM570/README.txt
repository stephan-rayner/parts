# Summary

I Remixed Foxpup's mount to tweak a few things:

1. The base is now an extrusion of the outer vertices
2. I eliminated most of the lower brim save for the parts that contact the mouse
3. a few things have been resized for fitment

The 45 degree mount also has a flared bottom for stability.

I included 20, 25, 30, and 45 degree mounts, but more can be generated from the blender file (which you will have to do if you want to play with z rotation of the tent). for more instructions see the 'How I designed this' section.

#### Resin casts

I've been expirementing with silicone molding, send me a message if you want a resin cast of this print!

# How I Designed This

## Designing a new angle from the blender file

You need to:

1. Rotate the base however much you like in the negative x direction
2. Hit view -> bottom and make sure 'limit selection to visible' is turned on.
3. Use 'b' to switch to boundary select mode and select all vertices you can see from the bottom.
4. Switch back to left or right view, extrude and constrain the extrusion to the z axis (I had to hit it twice for some reason) and place the extrusion well below the rest of the model. 
5. To flatten out the bottom hit scale, then type z then 0 to put all vertices of the extrusion on the same z plane.
6. Bring the bottom back up close to the rest of the model and you're done!
