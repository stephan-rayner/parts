# Summary

The remix by NightCrispy is much better than this. I no longer print my own design. Thank you, NightCrispy!

But wait! There's more! ReeseAllen Remixed NightCrispy's remix and added some special tool holders for drills, hammers, etc.

This fits 1" Spaced pegboard holes. It is a press fit. I currently use them in my kitchen to hold various tools.  

Put two together to hold a cellphone or tablet.  

I have not tested it to failure. If you want to do some testing, please add a comment.

# Print Settings

# Instructions

Do not allow the pegs to curl up from the print bed too much. Some warping is ok, but gross deformation will render them useless.
