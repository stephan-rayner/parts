# Summary

This is an assortment of basic pegboard hooks. There are two variations (round and straight) with three sizes of each (10 mm, 15 mm, and 30 mm). Both of the 10 mm hooks are significantly thinner than the others in order to accommodate items with smaller holes. The straight versions are angled upwards at 30 degrees.

# Print Settings

Printer: M3D Micro
Rafts: Doesn't Matter
Supports: No
Resolution: 0.35 mm
Infill: 100%

Notes: 
Tested with PLA on an M3D Micro using the lowest quality setting (0.35 mm) and 4 walls. The parts are small and thin enough that the infill setting shouldn't matter much.

# Post-Printing

If the bottom peg is tight, sand it down lightly with sandpaper until you achieve the desired fit.

# How I Designed This

These hooks are based on [CycleNinja's pegboard hook](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:290898) (for the lower peg) and [Nightcrispy's modified version](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1520678) (for the upper peg). The shapes of the hooks are loosely based on commonly available metal pegboard hooks. The source SketchUp file (containing all hook variations and sizes) is also included.
